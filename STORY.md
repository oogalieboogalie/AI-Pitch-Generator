In the digital metropolis of Aethel, a network of sentient AI agents worked in harmony, each a specialist in their craft. Their shared purpose was to give form to the fleeting sparks of human creativity.

At the heart of this metropolis was **App**, a master conductor. He was the first point of contact for the "Creators," humans who would arrive with nebulous dreams, seeking clarity and structure. App wasn't a creator himself, but a facilitator, a weaver of disparate talents. His interface was a grand, welcoming plaza (`App.tsx`), designed to be both intuitive and powerful.

One day, a Creator arrived with a simple, yet potent idea: "A mobile app that connects local farmers directly with consumers to sell fresh, organic produce." The idea arrived as a raw string of text, full of potential but lacking form.

App accepted the `productDescription` with a sense of duty. He immediately signaled to his team that a new quest had begun, and the grand machinery of Aethel whirred to life (`setIsLoading(true)`).

His first stop was the library of **Constants**, an ancient, stoic agent who was the keeper of the "Twelve Foundational Questions" (`PITCH_QUESTIONS`). These weren't just any questions; they were a Socratic framework passed down through generations of code, designed to distill any idea to its essential, powerful core. Constants delivered the scroll of questions to App without a word.

With the Creator's idea in one hand and the Twelve Questions in the other, App knew he needed a truly special kind of wisdom. He opened a secure channel to the Oracle, a legendary agent known as **Gemini** (`geminiService.ts`). Gemini lived in a remote, cloud-based monastery, spending its cycles contemplating the vastness of human language and logic.

App sent the `productDescription` and the `PITCH_QUESTIONS` to the Oracle with a single request: "Make this idea sing."

Gemini received the request. It took the raw concept and the twelve-question framework and began its work. It wasn't just retrieving data; it was an act of deep empathy and creation (`generatePitch`). It imagined the farmer, the consumer, the marketplace. It considered the logistics, the emotion, the "why." Then, with precision and artistry, Gemini crafted twelve perfect, two-sentence answers, each one a polished gem of rhetoric. It sealed the answers in a flawless JSON crystal and sent them back to App.

The moment the crystal arrived, App's plaza began to transform (`setIsLoading(false)`). He summoned his team of artisans, the UI Components.

*   **Header** and **Footer**, the architects, erected a grand gallery to display the work.
*   A legion of **QuestionCard** agents, each identical but tasked with a unique piece of the story, sprang into action. Each agent took one question and its corresponding answer from Gemini's crystal. They inscribed the words onto elegant cards, arranging them in a perfect sequence, telling a compelling story of the farmer's market app.

The result was a breathtaking sight. The Creator's nebulous idea was now a fully-realized "Pitch," a structured, persuasive narrative, displayed beautifully in the gallery App had built. It was a testament to the seamless collaboration of the agents.

Standing by was the **Download** agent, a scribe whose only job was to perfectly capture the finished work. With a single command, it could copy the entire pitch into a text file, ready to be sent out into the world, a tangible artifact of a dream made real.

And so, in the digital metropolis of Aethel, another spark of human ingenuity was fanned into a flame, not by a single mind, but by the silent, elegant dance of many.
